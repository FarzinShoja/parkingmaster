# Parking Master
RFID Parking Tags

# Project Overview
This project is a new way of parking management. We wish to create an application that allows students to locate free parking spots at GGC. However, our aim to main ambition is to use this project and assist GGC Parking Department and Campus Security. With these new RFID tags, our backend server and our user-friendly front-end interface; both departments can access each individual student data and update either the parking pass or request location or time log for each vehicle using the directory. RFID technology has been around for so many years but unfortunately, no one has taken ad advantage of it to this level. If the project is successful both GGC and the students/staff who worked on this project can benefit financially if this product to be distributed to other campus or business.
